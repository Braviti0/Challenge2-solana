# Challenge2-solana
The submission is in the index.js file
contained in codebase.js is recycled code from the previous Challenge that was used as part of this Challenge
index.js
checks if the sender balance is low (0.5 Sol or less)
balance is low, airdrops the sender 2 Sol and sends 50% (1 Sol to the receiver wallet)
balance is okay, then index.js will send 50% of the sender wallet balance (regardless of how much is in it)
